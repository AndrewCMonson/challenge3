# Challenge 3

## Password Generator
This application is used to generate random passwords based on user selection of:

- Character length (8-128 characters)
- Uppercase letters
- Lowercase letters
- Numbers
- Special Characters

Users are guided through a series of window prompts where the above selections are made and then printed to the screen.

## Reflection
- This project tested my knowledge of quite a few Javascript fundamentals including if statements, window alerts, prompts and confirmations, as well as interacting with the DOM.
- I chose to provide two solutions to a few areas of this project to test my own knowledge and also make the code more readable, accessible and succinct. My final version includes code up to the point that we have currently learned in my course as of weeks 3 and 4.
- Tools used to build this application include CSS3, HTML5 and JS.
